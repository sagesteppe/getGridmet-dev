# getGridmet

The purpose of this function is to automate downloading data products from the Gridmet website. While several options exist for performing this operation, this one is native to R, and suspect will be much simpler for a variety of persons to utilize. It allows the downloading of all the following metrics, for the entire time domain which the data cover.
